Exploration of recommender systems to expand ones horizons


###Defining the Problem
We are inundated with more and more options and information daily. One way to alleviate the overwhelming quantity of choice is recommender systems. We've all encountered these. Some good, others not so much. Popular examples include YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Amazon Kindle etc. But here's the thing. You click one thing. Perhaps it piqued your interest (hello clickbait), perhaps by accident or maybe a friend recommended it, and now you are stuck with items upon items of something that you didn't like/want or are no longer interested in. 

Now trying out something different comes with a cost that can be long lasting. So we start seeing a version of `social cooling', where you avoid exploring something outside of your comfort zone. 

In this project, I want to explore empowering end users with recommender systems, particular focusing on books.
